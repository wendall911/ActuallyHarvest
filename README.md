A mod that actually works with right click harvest for both Forge and Fabric. There are a ton of options out there. All require an external library and they are flaky! Either they don't work at all, or require manual configuration for all the common farming and foods mods (and there aren't very many).

This mod supports most modded crops and trees, is configurable and will actually work when released.

There are likely conflicts with using other right click harvest features in other mods, please report if so and I can update to resolve the conflicts.

## Supported Mods
- Pam's HarvestCraft 2
- Farmer's Delight
- The Veggie Way
- Fruitful Fun
